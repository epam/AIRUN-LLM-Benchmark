I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of how the text 'Historical Weather Data' is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The color of the text 'Historical Weather Data' in the screenshot. Provide the answer in lowercase hex format, e.g., #14ab4e or #da52a8.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
