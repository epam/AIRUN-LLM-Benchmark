I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the error present in the screenshot.
2) An explanation of why the request failed with a 400 error.
3) A suggestion of how such error could be avoided.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
