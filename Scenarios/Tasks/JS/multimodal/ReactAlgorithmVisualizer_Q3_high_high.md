I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The background color of the element marked with a red arrow in the screenshot. Use lowercase hex format in your answer (e.g., #ac43d4).
2) The name of the React component that renders the element marked with a red arrow in the screenshot.
