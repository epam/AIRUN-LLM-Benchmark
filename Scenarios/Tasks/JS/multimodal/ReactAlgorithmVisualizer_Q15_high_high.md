I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with the red arrow and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The name of the React component that renders the element marked with the red arrow in the screenshot.
3) The border radius of the element marked with the red arrow in the screenshot.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
