I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The name of the React component that renders the element marked with a red arrow in the screenshot.
2) The border radius of the element marked with a red arrow in the screenshot.
