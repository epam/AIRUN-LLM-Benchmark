I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element selected in dev tools and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The width in pixels of the element selected in the dev tools.
3) The height in pixels of the element selected in the dev tools.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
