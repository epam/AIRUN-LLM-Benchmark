I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with the red rectangle and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) A list of all the changes happening after the user clicks the area marked with the red rectangle in the screenshot.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
