I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element containing the text '1 / 1949' and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The text color of the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.
3) The background color of the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.
4) The React component name that renders the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.

Report colors in lowercase hex format, e.g., #fa2cd4, #48fc38.
Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
