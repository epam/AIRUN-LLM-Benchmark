I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The text color of the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.
2) The background color of the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.
3) The React component name that renders the element containing the text '1 / 1949'.

Report colors in lowercase hex format, e.g., #fa2cd4.
