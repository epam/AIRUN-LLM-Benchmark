I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the errors visible in the screenshot.
2) The exact line of code (not the line number, but the line text) where the errors visible in the screenshot occur.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
