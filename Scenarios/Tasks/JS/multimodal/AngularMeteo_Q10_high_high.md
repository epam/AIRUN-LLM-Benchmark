I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The exact line of code (not the line number, but the line text) where the errors visible in the screenshot occur.
