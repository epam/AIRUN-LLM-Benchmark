I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with the red rectangle and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The name of the service that provides data for the control in the red rectangle.
3) The name of the method in the service that provides data for the control in the red rectangle.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
