I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) The height in pixels of the visual element marked with the red arrows in the screenshot.
2) Description of the visual element and explation how it is rendered referencing codebase.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
