I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with the red arrows and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The color of the visual element marked with the red arrows in the screenshot. Provide the answer in lowercase hex format, e.g., #14ab4e, #da52a8.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
