I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with the red rectangle in the screenshot and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The path of the API endpoint that provides data for the element marked with a red rectangle in the screenshot. Provide the answer without domain and with leading slash (ex. /path/to/endpoint)

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
