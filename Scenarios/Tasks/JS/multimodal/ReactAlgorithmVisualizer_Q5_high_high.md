I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element marked with red arrow and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) A list of all visual changes happenning on the page after the user clicks the element marked with the red arrow (using references to the codebase).

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
