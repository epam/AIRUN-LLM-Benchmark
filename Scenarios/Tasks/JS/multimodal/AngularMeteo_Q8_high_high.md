I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The name of the component that renders the element marked with a red arrow in the HTML template.
2) The name of the component property that is bound to the element marked with the red arrow.
