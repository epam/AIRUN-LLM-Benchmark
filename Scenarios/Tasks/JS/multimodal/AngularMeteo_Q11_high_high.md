I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The border radius in pixels of the element with the text 'Europe/Moscow'.
2) The border color in lowercase hex format of the element with the text 'Europe/Moscow' (for example: #1f4ac5).
