I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element with the text 'Text592' explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
1) The border radius in pixels of the element with the text 'Text592'.
2) The border color in lowercase hex format of the element with the text 'Text592' (for example: #1f4ac5, #ba37f3).

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
