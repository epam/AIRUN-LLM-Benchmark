I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to analyze the screenshot and codebase, then provide the following information:
1) The tag name of the element selected in the dev tools.
2) The React component name that renders the selected element.
3) The name of the method that is called when the selected element is clicked.
