I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) The tag name of the element selected in the dev tools.
2) The React component name that directly renders the selected element.
3) The name of the method that is called when the selected element is clicked.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
