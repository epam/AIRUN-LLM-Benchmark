I have the following application code:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactAlgorithmVisualizer"/>
</source_code>

Your task is to perform analysis of the screenshot and codebase. The goal of the analysis is to provide the following information:
1) A description of the visual element selected in the dev tools and explanation how it is rendered (using references to the codebase).
2) The name of the method (and the name of the component) which is executed when the user clicks the element selected in the dev tools.

Ensure that the analysis is included in your response.
