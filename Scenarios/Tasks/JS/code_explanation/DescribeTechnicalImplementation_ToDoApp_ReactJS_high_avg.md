I have the following application code that needs to document:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ToDoApp_ReactJS"/>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Create comprehensive technical documentation for the provided React component:
   - Include a clear, concise overview of the component's purpose and functionality
   - Document all key features and capabilities
   - Maintain a professional, technical writing style throughout

2. Document component structure and interface:
   - List and describe all props with their names, types, and descriptions
   - Clearly indicate which props are required vs. optional
   - Document the component's state management approach

3. Provide usage instructions:
   - Include sample code demonstrating proper implementation
   - Show typical usage patterns and configurations
   - Demonstrate how to integrate the component within a React application

4. Document accessibility features:
   - Detail all ARIA roles and attributes implemented
   - Explain how the component supports assistive technologies
   - Describe keyboard navigation support and focus management

5. Include implementation details:
   - Document any performance optimizations (like shouldComponentUpdate)
   - Explain component lifecycle methods and their purpose
   - Note any dependencies or requirements

6. Conclude with summary information:
   - Highlight the component's benefits and value proposition
   - Summarize how it contributes to creating accessible, user-friendly interfaces
   - Note any best practices for implementation

7. Format the documentation professionally:
   - Use clear section headings and consistent formatting
   - Include tables for structured data like props
   - Ensure all technical terms are accurately used
