I have the following Angular application code that requires comprehensive technical documentation:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Create detailed technical documentation following these requirements:

1. **Architecture Documentation Requirements:**
   - Document standalone component architecture patterns used in Angular 19
   - Explain service-based dependency injection implementation approach
   - Detail component hierarchy and communication patterns
   - Document folder structure and modular organization principles

2. **Component Technical Specifications:**
   - Provide complete interface documentation for all components with inputs/outputs
   - Document OnPush change detection strategy implementation
   - Explain signal-based reactive programming patterns where used
   - Include TypeScript type definitions and generic implementations

3. **Canvas API and Data Visualization Implementation:**
   - Document Canvas 2D rendering context usage and ImageData manipulation
   - Explain waterfall chart rendering algorithms and pixel-level operations
   - Detail color palette mapping and RGB conversion implementations
   - Document canvas sizing, coordinate systems, and performance optimizations

4. **Service Architecture and API Integration:**
   - Document Open-Meteo API integration patterns and SDK usage
   - Explain async data processing pipelines and error handling strategies
   - Detail weather data transformation algorithms and time series processing
   - Document service injection patterns and dependency management

5. **Data Processing and Algorithm Documentation:**
   - Explain waterfall data structure creation and time-based aggregation
   - Document weather data point processing and validation logic
   - Detail coordinate and timezone handling implementations
   - Explain autocomplete search algorithms and data filtering

6. **Performance and Technical Implementation Patterns:**
   - Document memory management strategies for large canvas operations
   - Explain component lifecycle optimization techniques
   - Detail async operation patterns and loading state management
   - Document technical design decisions and architectural tradeoffs

**Documentation Standards:**
- Use structured sections with clear technical headings
- Include code examples for complex implementation patterns
- Provide interface definitions and type specifications
- Maintain focus on technical implementation rather than functional behavior
- Document all public APIs, inputs, outputs, and method signatures
