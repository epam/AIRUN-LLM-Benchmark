I have the following application code that needs to evaluate:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="AngularMeteo"/>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the provided Angular weather data application code:
   - Identify issues across multiple technical dimensions
   - Provide specific recommendations with code examples

2. Readability Assessment:
   - Identify unclear variable names, functions, or code blocks
   - Suggest clearer alternatives with specific code examples
   - Highlight complex logic that could be simplified

3. Maintainability Evaluation:
   - Identify non-modular or tightly coupled components
   - Suggest architectural improvements for better separation of concerns
   - Provide examples of more maintainable code structures

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Identify inefficient data handling or canvas rendering operations
   - Highlight potential memory leaks in canvas operations
   - Suggest optimized alternatives for weather data processing

5. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Review UI components for accessibility compliance
   - Suggest ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, or focus management enhancements
   - Provide code examples demonstrating accessibility best practices for data visualization

6. Angular Best Practices:
   - Identify outdated patterns or anti-patterns
   - Suggest modern Angular approaches (signals, standalone components, control flow)
   - Provide examples aligning with current Angular 19+ recommendations

7. Service and Data Management Evaluation:
   - Review service implementation for best practices
   - Identify potential data management improvements
   - Suggest optimization for API calls and weather data processing

8. Canvas and Visualization Assessment:
   - Evaluate canvas rendering implementation for performance
   - Identify opportunities for optimization in waterfall chart rendering
   - Suggest improvements for color palette and data visualization

9. Security and Error Handling Assessment:
   - Review API integration security patterns and data validation
   - Evaluate error handling mechanisms across components and services
   - Assess geolocation data handling for security and privacy considerations
   - Suggest improvements for robust error recovery patterns

10. Response Format Requirements:
   - Organize findings by aspect (Readability, Maintainability, etc.)
   - For each issue identified:
     - Provide a descriptive name
     - Include a clear explanation
     - Show the problematic code snippet
     - Provide a corrected code example where applicable
