Your task is to modify the application on React 18.x, which utilizes the SWAPI open API.
You should add a character search functionality and optimize it efficiently (avoid overloading the Backend with requests).

</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Implement a search functionality for a React 18.x application:
   - Add a search input field to filter characters by name
   - Do not overload the backend with requests
   - Preserve initial data loading behavior

2. API Integration requirements:
   - Continue using axios for API requests
   - Send an initial empty search query on component mount
   - Format search requests according to the API specifications
   - Handle API errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback

3. User Interface requirements:
   - Display a loading indicator during API requests
   - Show search results dynamically as users type
   - Implement responsive design for the search component
   - Provide visual feedback when no results are found

4. Technical implementation requirements:
   - Use TypeScript with proper type definitions for all components and functions
   - Maintain strict typing for API responses and component props
   - Implement proper state management for search queries and results
   - Apply performance optimizations where applicable (useMemo, useCallback)

5. Code quality standards:
   - Write clean, production-ready code without TODOs or commented-out code
   - Follow React best practices and patterns
   - Ensure all components are properly typed
   - Implement error boundaries where appropriate
