I have the following application code that needs to migrate:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactSignUp"/>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Migrate the provided React code to Angular 14.x:
   - Assume all non-provided code has been migrated with the same contract
   - Implement equivalent functionality while following Angular best practices

2. Architecture requirements:
   - Use @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects where appropriate for state management
   - Split large files into separate components or functions
   - Maintain the same validation logic and error handling

3. Form implementation:
   - Convert Redux Form to Angular Reactive Forms
   - Implement equivalent form validation (both synchronous and asynchronous)
   - Preserve all validation rules and error messages
   - Maintain field-level validation behavior

4. Component structure:
   - Create equivalent Angular components for each React component
   - Implement proper component lifecycle methods
   - Maintain parent-child component relationships

5. Routing:
   - Convert React Router links to Angular Router navigation
   - Preserve all route paths and navigation logic

6. API integration:
   - Maintain all API calls using Angular HttpClient
   - Preserve promise-based logic as Observable patterns
   - Implement proper error handling

7. UI requirements:
   - Convert React Bootstrap components to Angular equivalents
   - Maintain the same visual appearance and layout
   - Preserve all icons and visual elements

8. Code quality:
   - Optimize code where possible
   - Do not include any TODOs in the final code
   - Follow Angular style guide and best practices

9. Deliverable format:
   - Return translated code as markdown code snippets
   - Provide complete implementation without additional comments or explanations
