I have the following application code that needs to migrate:

<source_code>
<place_code_here>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Migrate the provided vanilla JavaScript application to React 18:
   - Use Create React App with TypeScript configuration
   - Implement strict TypeScript typing throughout the application
   - Preserve all existing functionality and behavior

2. Component Structure:
   - Create appropriate functional components with React hooks
   - Implement proper state management for UI interactions
   - Ensure event handling follows React patterns

3. Audio Implementation:
   - Properly handle audio resources in the React environment
   - Implement audio playback with appropriate React lifecycle considerations
   - Maintain the existing audio mapping structure with TypeScript interfaces

4. Event Handling:
   - Convert DOM event listeners to React synthetic events
   - Implement keyboard event handling at appropriate component levels
   - Ensure mouse interactions work identically to the original implementation

5. UI State Management:
   - Implement state for active keys and button selections
   - Ensure proper class toggling for visual feedback
   - Maintain the Notes/Letters toggle functionality

6. Fullscreen Functionality:
   - Implement the fullscreen toggle using React patterns
   - Handle browser compatibility for fullscreen API

7. Styling Requirements:
   - Preserve all CSS classes and styling behavior
   - Implement conditional class application using React patterns
   - Maintain responsive design aspects

8. Optimization:
   - Implement performance optimizations where appropriate
   - Use React.memo or other techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Ensure efficient event handling for piano key interactions

9. Code Quality:
   - Follow React best practices and patterns
   - Ensure code is clean, readable, and maintainable
   - No TODOs should be present in the final code
