I have the following application code that needs comprehensive unit testing:

<source_code>
<place_code_here>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Testing Environment Setup:
   - Select appropriate testing libraries for React with TypeScript (Jest, React Testing Library, etc.)
   - Configure the testing environment with proper TypeScript support
   - Set up necessary test configuration files (jest.config.js, setupTests.ts, etc.)

2. Test Coverage Requirements:
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all components
   - Prioritize testing of critical business logic in model classes
   - Create separate test files for each component/module following naming convention: `[filename].test.tsx`

3. Component Testing Approach:
   - Write tests for component rendering and UI state verification
   - Test component lifecycle methods functionality
   - Verify event handling (keyboard events, clicks, form submissions)
   - Test conditional rendering logic based on props/state

4. Data Management Testing:
   - Test data flow between components using props
   - Validate state management functionality
   - Verify proper handling of user inputs
   - Test local storage interactions with appropriate mocks

5. Mocking Requirements:
   - Mock external dependencies and browser APIs (localStorage, etc.)
   - Create test fixtures for sample data
   - Implement mocks for routing functionality
   - Simulate DOM events for interaction testing

6. Test Quality Guidelines:
   - Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on each other
   - Cover both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions
   - Structure tests with proper describe/it blocks for readability
   - Implement proper assertions with meaningful error messages

7. Delivery Requirements:
   - Provide complete working test suite with no TODOs or placeholder code
   - Ensure all tests pass successfully
   - Include any necessary instructions for running tests
   - Do not modify the original application code
