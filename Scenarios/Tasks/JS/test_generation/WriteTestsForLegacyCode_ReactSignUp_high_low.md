I have the following application code that needs comprehensive unit testing:

<source_code>
<place_code_here>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Set up a complete testing environment:
   - Select and install appropriate testing libraries for React components
   - Configure test runners and utilities for Redux-connected components
   - Set up mocking utilities for API calls and external dependencies

2. Write comprehensive unit tests for all components:
   - Test both presentational and container components
   - Cover form validation logic (both synchronous and asynchronous)
   - Test form submission handling and error states
   - Verify proper rendering of form elements and error messages

3. Implement proper test isolation:
   - Mock all external API calls and async operations
   - Create proper test fixtures for form data
   - Use test doubles for Redux store interactions
   - Isolate component tests from their dependencies

4. Ensure thorough test coverage:
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all files
   - Test all conditional branches and error handling paths
   - Verify form validation rules function correctly
   - Test both success and failure scenarios

5. Follow testing best practices:
   - Structure tests in a readable, maintainable way
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
   - Implement setup and teardown procedures as appropriate
   - Verify component lifecycle methods function correctly

6. Deliver production-ready test suite:
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently
   - Remove any debug code, console logs, or TODOs
   - Optimize tests for execution speed where possible
   - Provide clean, focused test implementations without extraneous comments
