I have the following application code that needs comprehensive unit testing:

<source_code>
<place_code_here repo="ReactSelect"/>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Test Environment Setup:
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library
   - Configure necessary test utilities for event handling
   - Ensure proper DOM environment simulation

2. Component Rendering Tests:
   - Test basic component rendering with default props
   - Verify proper DOM structure and accessibility attributes
   - Validate that required props are properly applied to the rendered output

3. User Interaction Testing:
   - Test keyboard navigation functionality (arrows, tab, enter, escape keys)
   - Test mouse interactions (clicking, hovering, focusing elements)
   - Simulate touch events for mobile device compatibility

4. State Management Tests:
   - Verify controlled and uncontrolled component behavior
   - Test state changes when selecting, removing, and clearing values
   - Ensure proper focus management during interactions

5. Menu and Options Tests:
   - Test menu opening/closing behavior
   - Verify option filtering and searching functionality
   - Validate option selection, deselection, and multi-select behavior

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
   - Test keyboard-only navigation flows
   - Ensure focus trapping and management works correctly

7. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test component behavior with empty options
   - Test loading and error states
   - Verify component behavior with disabled options/states

8. Performance Testing:
   - Test rendering performance with large option sets
   - Verify optimization features work correctly

9. Test Coverage Requirements:
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage
   - Use mocking for external dependencies
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all component props

10. Test Documentation:
    - Document test cases clearly
    - Group related tests logically
    - Include setup and teardown procedures where needed
