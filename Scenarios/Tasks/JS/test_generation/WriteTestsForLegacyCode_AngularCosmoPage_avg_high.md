I have the following application code that needs comprehensive unit testing:

<source_code>
<place_code_here>
</source_code>

Please follow these steps:

1. Create comprehensive unit tests for the AngularJS application:
   - Focus on testing controllers, factories, and services
   - Test all public methods and functions
   - Verify component interactions and data flow
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. Select and implement appropriate testing tools:
   - Choose a testing framework (such as Jasmine, Jest, or Karma)
   - Set up the necessary testing environment configuration
   - Configure mocks and spies for dependency isolation
   - Implement test runners for automated execution

3. Implement proper test structure:
   - Organize tests hierarchically (describe/it pattern)
   - Use beforeEach/afterEach for proper test isolation
   - Group related tests into logical test suites
   - Provide clear, descriptive test names

4. Handle external dependencies:
   - Mock all HTTP requests and API calls
   - Create appropriate stubs for external services
   - Simulate user interactions where needed
   - Mock browser functionality as required

5. Ensure comprehensive test coverage:
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
   - Focus on critical business logic paths
   - Test all conditional branches
   - Verify error handling and edge cases

6. Deliver production-ready test suite:
   - Include necessary configuration files
   - Ensure all tests can run independently
   - No TODO comments or placeholders in final code
   - Optimize test execution performance

7. Validate test effectiveness:
   - Verify tests catch actual defects
   - Ensure tests fail when implementation breaks
   - Check for false positives/negatives
